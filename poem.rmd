## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

And cannot pleasures, while they last,  
Be actual unless, when past,  
They leave us shuddering and aghast,  
With anguish smarting?  
And cannot friends be firm and fast,

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
The river hums a silver tune,
Beneath the watchful, golden moon.
The trees, like elders, bend and sigh,
Their voices woven with the sky.

A fox slips past on silent feet,
A fleeting ghost where shadows meet.
The fireflies blink in coded light,
Soft lanterns in the arms of night.

The wind, a painter, sweeps the land,
Brushing hills with careful hand.
It sings through reeds, it shapes the shore,
A melody forevermore.

The mountains stand with steadfast grace,
Their peaks untouched by time’s embrace.
The dawn spills gold upon their spines,
Like verses drawn in sacred lines.

Here, nature whispers, bold yet still,
A symphony no hand can still.
If only we would pause and hear,
The wild speaks love—so bright, so clear.
